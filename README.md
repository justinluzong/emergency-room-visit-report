# Emergency Room Visit Report

[Emergency Room Visit Report on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/justinluzong/viz/EmergencyRoomVisitReport_17443380889530/ERExperience)

## Overview
This report provides an overview of patient visits to a hospital emergency room. The goal of this report is to improve the overall ER patient experience at this hospital by optimizing wait times and catering to the needs of notable demographics.  
This report is comprised of the following dashboards:
- Emergency Room Experience Report - focuses on patient satisfaction ratings and wait times
- Emergency Room Demographics Report - focuses on patient count, gender, age group, race/ethnicity, and department referrals
- Data Source - displays dataset used in this project

## Dataset
This project uses Mark Bradbourne's [Real World Fake Data "Hospital ER" dataset](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Hospital+ER.csv)

These are findings from my initial look through the dataset:
- The fictional Patient IDs in this dataset appear to be formatted like Social Security Numbers, which is not how they would typically be formatted.
- The range of values for the Patient Satisfaction Score column is 0 to 10 instead of a more likely to be expected 1 to 10. A majority of the records have NULL values for this column. 
- It is unclear what the purpose of the Patient Admin Flag column is, so it has not been utilized in the project.
